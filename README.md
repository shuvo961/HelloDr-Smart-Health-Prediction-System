It might have happened so many times that you or someone needs doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some reason. The Health Prediction system is an end user support and online consultation project which aims to provide initial and instant health support. Here we propose a system that allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care system online. The system is fed with various symptoms and the disease/illness associated with those systems. The system allows user to share their symptoms and issues. The system processes & determines the best possible match on basis of the symptoms given. The system will suggest doctors according to the detected disease. Depending on situation the system urges users to go for blood test, X-ray, CT-scan or whichever report it feels user’s symptoms are associated with for more accurate result, so next time user may be able to login and upload an image of those reports. The system also has a doctor dashboard, the uploaded images are sent to respective doctor along with patient contact details. The doctors may now contact the patient for further process.

This project will ensure to health safety to the people.
•	User can search for doctor’s help at any point of time.
•	User can talk about their illness and get instant diagnosis.
•	Doctors get more clients online.
